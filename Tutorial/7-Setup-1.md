To begin, we will import the necessary libraries for our project.

In your `main.py` file, include the following code:

```python
import os
import openai
```
The first import statement grants you access to Python's built-in os module. This module will be used to import your OpenAI API key.

The second import statement allows you to utilize the OpenAI library. This library provides convenient methods for making requests to the OpenAI platform.
