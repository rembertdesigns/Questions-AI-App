To begin this app, you will need to obtain an OpenAI API key.

An API key serves as a unique identifier that grants you access to an API (Application Programming Interface). Think of it as a password that enables you to make requests to the API server and utilize its functionalities.

You can acquire your OpenAI API key by [following this link](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

Once you have obtained your key, it is essential to save it as an environment variable.

In Replit, you can conveniently achieve this using the "Secrets" tool. Located on the left side, under the file explorer, you will find the "tools" section. Click on the "Secrets" tool, which is represented by a lock icon.

Once inside the Secrets Tool, follow these steps:

- Enter "OPENAI_API_KEY" in the "key" input field.
- Input your OpenAI API Key in the "value" input field.
- Click the "Add new secret" button.

By following these steps, your key will be securely stored, allowing you to access it within your code.

With your API key securely saved, you are now fully prepared to embark on your coding journey!
